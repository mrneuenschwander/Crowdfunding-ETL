# Crowdfunding-ETL
Extracting, Transforming, and Loading

## Purpose

This challenge and module was intended to expose us to the wiles of various ETL processes via PANDAS, PostgreSQL, and the other things contained here in my profile. Little of everything we've done so far was rolled into this, and presented the greatest challenge to date (with respect to the scope alone, the rest was fine).

I greatly enjoy the ETL process, scrubbing and subsequently presenting the requested data based on queries that are in themselves sometimes lil puzzles is a great time for me. Please sir, may I have some more?
